# EXAFS-simulations
Python script (for colab.google) + data files needed to simulate EXAFS
These materials were developed for Biophysics 401 at the University of Michigan
to illustrate EXAFS spectra from 2 shells of scatterers and to be used with a set 
of active learning exercises.

The notebook is intended to run on colab, using data from 3 files.

1) McKale.pk  is a pickled version of 2-D interpolators calculated from McKale's amplitude and scattering factors (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 110 (12) 3763068 (1988)
2) TeoLee.pk is a 2-D interpolator calculated from Teo-Lee central atom phase shifts (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 101, 2815â€“2832. https://doi.org/10.1021/JA00505A003)
3) elem.pk is a list of chemical elements and symbols
